# Changes to the bot on (1.0.5);

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of this update being bigger than usual, the update is split into multiple ones, the next couple versions all fall under `1.0.5`!

>  These change logs are nothing but public, these are not private it in anyway and never will be. Anyone can access and view these! If you have suggestions/issues with anything please send a message to me in [The Discord]("https://discord.gg/8t69CgCyb5")

## - Client, Websocket, and Components;
- The channel fetching is now linked to a cache, every channel fetched will be cached and saved for the the future
- Websockets now have `run on "ready"` prevention, it will no longer run any events if the handler is not yet ready to handle requests 
- Uptime is now more accurate instead of outputting a random time
- The new `Anti Me` script (*This is a script that will prevent random servers from using the bot*) is now operating and is running faster than before
- Uptime does not reset once the bot has to refresh its session, it will now be stored until the bot is updated, meaning even with a crash it will not change. This is done because of the fact that the uptime counter keeps going down to 0 because of the bot having refresh for new data
- Button component is going to get a new update to defer the button before editing, this will allow the button to stop showing the `LOADING` state once the user clicks
- StaffModule has been added (*This allows certain users to still use the bot during for example: Maintenace*)<br>

> [!WARNING]

### - Commands
- `Change Log` command now has buttons to go thru previous versions `[BETA]`
- `get-info` is going to get an update to keep looking for the user if only the username is provided.


## - Auto updater;
- Introducing `AUTO UPDATER` our script to automatically update the code based on an update, the code is made so that updates can be pushed without having to manually restart or even edit the code thru the `VPS` *(Virtual Private Server)*, this allows for faster updates and less down time
- Every update is identified with an unique code, you'll see these codes on embeds of every commands, These are for debugging purposes only and should not be cared about by daily users.<br>
