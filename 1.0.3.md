>  These change logs are nothing but public, these are not private it in anyway and never will be. Anyone can access and view these! If you have suggestions/issues with anything please send a message to me in [The Discord]("https://discord.gg/8t69CgCyb5")

## - Server checking;
* The function has gotten a rewrite due to the slow speed's of a local file, now it uses a Database to store and check

## - Client, Websocket, and Components;
* Added new states such as: `Prisma`, `ready`
* Websocket handler is now faster, added new functions such as `client.channels.get`
* Websocket handler no longer crashes the bot if an error accurs, it will log and try again


## - Handlers (Logs, Commands, Events, Errors);
* Added an event handler for events like "clientReady"
* Error handler has been updated to support custom errors made by the Client or custom scripts
* Commands are getting a rewrite in a future update
* New logs handler
    - Logs: A server can now customize their logs based on what they want to log in their server
    - Options - Basic server logs, and Dashboard logs. These logs consist of:
        - Channel logs (Log anything that is related to Channels)
        - Message logs (Log anything that is related to Messages)
        - Role logs (Log anything that is related to Roles)
        - Member logs (Log anything that is related to Members)
        - Moderation logs (This will log stuff such as when a command is executed, when a command fails to execute, if a user edits stuff on the dashboard, and if someone accesses the dashboard.)
    - These logs have a 5 second cooldown
